# SecPi

SecPi is an open source project which gives people the ability to build their own inexpensive, expandable and feature-rich alarm system. We tailored the system to run on the Raspberry Pi but other platforms like the Banana Pi and any other Linux machine should be capable to run the software too. With SecPi it's also possible to connect multiple systems via a network connection and have them work together.
